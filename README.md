# python_SDL_OpenGL_SpaceShip
A spaceship that flies around 3D space with oncoming enemies. This program experiments with python using SDL combined with OpenGL.

Run main.py to play the game. Main, Ship, Camera, and Bullet are written by me while most of the other .py files were written or received by my professor.
